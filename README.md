## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Full-Stack Mobile Developer** with around **3 years of experience** building reliable, user-friendly **mobile applications and backend systems**.

I work with **startups, businesses, and teams** to transform ideas into fully functional digital products. My core expertise lies in building **cross-platform mobile apps** using **React Native** and **scalable backend systems** using **Node.js and NestJS**, supported by **MongoDB** and **Redis**.

I’ve worked in **product-based companies**, **project-based teams**, and as a **freelance developer**, which has helped me adapt quickly to different business needs, timelines, and communication styles.

I’m comfortable **leading teams**, collaborating with designers and stakeholders, or working independently as a **solo developer**, owning projects end-to-end — from planning to deployment.

Currently, I’m expanding my skill set in **DevOps and Cloud**, focusing on better deployments, automation, and scalability.
